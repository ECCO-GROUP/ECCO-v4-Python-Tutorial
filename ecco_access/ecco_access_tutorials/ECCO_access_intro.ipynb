    "\n",
    "In the past several years since ECCOv4 release 4 output was made available on the Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center or [PO.DAAC](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov), a number of Python scripts/functions have been written to facilitate requests of this output, authored by Jack McNelis, Ian Fenty, and Andrew Delman. To make access easier and standardize the format of these requests, the **ecco_access** library has been made available in the `ecco_access` folder of the [ECCO-v4-Python-Tutorial](https://github.com/ECCO-GROUP/ECCO-v4-Python-Tutorial/tree/master/ecco_access) Github repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will help you set up **ecco_access** so that you can import it into your notebooks and code as a Python package, i.e., with `import ecco_access`. The tutorial also introduces the two top-level functions in **ecco_access**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ecco_podaac_to_xrdataset`: takes as input a text query or ECCO dataset identifier, and returns an *xarray* Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ecco_podaac_access`: takes the same input, but returns the URLs/paths or local files where the data is located\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions support a number of access modes for querying the datasets, downloading the datasets, or accessing through S3 cloud storage. For more examples of these modes, you can look at the [ECCO access modes](https://ecco-v4-python-tutorial.readthedocs.io/ECCO_access_modes.html) tutorial.\n",

    "\n",
    "## ECCO output on PO.DAAC\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up Earthdata login credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "An account with NASA Earthdata is required to access ECCO output hosted in the AWS Cloud by PO.DAAC. Please visit [https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/home](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/home) to make an account.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Earthdata Login provides a single mechanism for user registration and profile management for all EOSDIS system components (DAACs, Tools, Services). Your Earthdata login also helps the EOSDIS program better understand the usage of EOSDIS services to improve user experience through customization of tools and improvement of services. EOSDIS data are openly available to all and free of charge except where governed by international agreements.*\n",

To be safe, do not use any of the following characters in your password: backslash (\\\\), space, hash (#), quotes (single or double), or greater than (>).

    "### ECCO output structure on PO.DAAC\n",
    "\n",
    "On PO.DAAC and in the NASA Earthdata Cloud, ECCO output is organized in the following hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset:** Typically contains a few variables, spanning the time range of the ECCO v4r4 output (currently 1992-2017). Most datasets are divided (in the time dimension) into hundreds or thousands of granules.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Granule:** Dataset variables at a specific time (monthly mean, daily mean, or snapshot). Exceptions are 1-D time series where the entire dataset only consists of one granule.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Variable:** A specific geophysical parameter (or flux) representing the state of the ocean, atmosphere, or sea ice/snow cover. Individual variables are not visible through the NASA Earthdata website, but can be seen after a granule file has been opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each dataset has a dataset code called a `ShortName` which is used to identify it on the cloud. In order to download particular variable(s), you need to identify the `ShortName` associated with the dataset containing those variables. You can search for the variables in the linked text files below, or download these files for your reference.\n",

Note: SSH is calculated by correcting model sea level anomaly ETAN for three effects: a) global mean steric sea level changes related to density changes in the Boussinesq volume-conserving model (Greatbatch correction, see sterGloH), b) the inverted barometer (IB) effect (see SSHIBC) and c) sea level displacement due to sea-ice and snow pressure loading (see sIceLoad). SSH can be compared with the similarly-named SSH variable in previous ECCO products that did not include atmospheric pressure loading (e.g., Version 4 Release 3). Use SSHNOIBC for comparisons with altimetry data products that do NOT apply the IB correction.</dd><dt><span>valid_min :</span></dt><dd>-1.8805772066116333</dd><dt><span>valid_max :</span></dt><dd>1.4207719564437866</dd></dl></div><div class='xr-var-data'><table>\n",

Note: SSHNOIBC is calculated by correcting model sea level anomaly ETAN for two effects: a) global mean steric sea level changes related to density changes in the Boussinesq volume-conserving model (Greatbatch correction, see sterGloH), b) sea level displacement due to sea-ice and snow pressure loading (see sIceLoad). In ECCO Version 4 Release 4 the model is forced with atmospheric pressure loading. SSHNOIBC does not correct for the static part of the effect of atmosphere pressure loading on sea surface height (the so-called inverse barometer (IB) correction).

Note: ETAN is model sea level anomaly and should not be compared with satellite altimetery products, see SSH and ETAN for more details.</dd><dt><span>Conventions :</span></dt><dd>CF-1.8, ACDD-1.3</dd><dt><span>coordinates_comment :</span></dt><dd>Note: the global &#x27;coordinates&#x27; attribute describes auxillary coordinates.</dd><dt><span>creator_email :</span></dt><dd>ecco-group@mit.edu</dd><dt><span>creator_institution :</span></dt><dd>NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)</dd><dt><span>creator_name :</span></dt><dd>ECCO Consortium</dd><dt><span>creator_type :</span></dt><dd>group</dd><dt><span>creator_url :</span></dt><dd>https://ecco-group.org</dd><dt><span>date_created :</span></dt><dd>2020-12-16T18:07:36</dd><dt><span>date_issued :</span></dt><dd>2020-12-16T18:07:36</dd><dt><span>date_metadata_modified :</span></dt><dd>2021-03-15T21:57:04</dd><dt><span>date_modified :</span></dt><dd>2021-03-15T21:57:04</dd><dt><span>geospatial_bounds_crs :</span></dt><dd>EPSG:4326</dd><dt><span>geospatial_lat_max :</span></dt><dd>90.0</dd><dt><span>geospatial_lat_min :</span></dt><dd>-90.0</dd><dt><span>geospatial_lat_resolution :</span></dt><dd>variable</dd><dt><span>geospatial_lat_units :</span></dt><dd>degrees_north</dd><dt><span>geospatial_lon_max :</span></dt><dd>180.0</dd><dt><span>geospatial_lon_min :</span></dt><dd>-180.0</dd><dt><span>geospatial_lon_resolution :</span></dt><dd>variable</dd><dt><span>geospatial_lon_units :</span></dt><dd>degrees_east</dd><dt><span>history :</span></dt><dd>Inaugural release of an ECCO Central Estimate solution to PO.DAAC</dd><dt><span>id :</span></dt><dd>10.5067/ECL5M-SSH44</dd><dt><span>institution :</span></dt><dd>NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)</dd><dt><span>instrument_vocabulary :</span></dt><dd>GCMD instrument keywords</dd><dt><span>keywords :</span></dt><dd>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; OCEANS &gt; SEA SURFACE TOPOGRAPHY &gt; SEA SURFACE HEIGHT, EARTH SCIENCE SERVICES &gt; MODELS &gt; EARTH SCIENCE REANALYSES/ASSIMILATION MODELS</dd><dt><span>keywords_vocabulary :</span></dt><dd>NASA Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) Science Keywords</dd><dt><span>license :</span></dt><dd>Public Domain</dd><dt><span>metadata_link :</span></dt><dd>https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/collections.umm_json?ShortName=ECCO_L4_SSH_LLC0090GRID_MONTHLY_V4R4</dd><dt><span>naming_authority :</span></dt><dd>gov.nasa.jpl</dd><dt><span>platform :</span></dt><dd>ERS-1/2, TOPEX/Poseidon, Geosat Follow-On (GFO), ENVISAT, Jason-1, Jason-2, CryoSat-2, SARAL/AltiKa, Jason-3, AVHRR, Aquarius, SSM/I, SSMIS, GRACE, DTU17MDT, Argo, WOCE, GO-SHIP, MEOP, Ice Tethered Profilers (ITP)</dd><dt><span>platform_vocabulary :</span></dt><dd>GCMD platform keywords</dd><dt><span>processing_level :</span></dt><dd>L4</dd><dt><span>product_name :</span></dt><dd>SEA_SURFACE_HEIGHT_mon_mean_2017-01_ECCO_V4r4_native_llc0090.nc</dd><dt><span>product_time_coverage_end :</span></dt><dd>2018-01-01T00:00:00</dd><dt><span>product_time_coverage_start :</span></dt><dd>1992-01-01T12:00:00</dd><dt><span>product_version :</span></dt><dd>Version 4, Release 4</dd><dt><span>program :</span></dt><dd>NASA Physical Oceanography, Cryosphere, Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction (MAP)</dd><dt><span>project :</span></dt><dd>Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO)</dd><dt><span>publisher_email :</span></dt><dd>podaac@podaac.jpl.nasa.gov</dd><dt><span>publisher_institution :</span></dt><dd>PO.DAAC</dd><dt><span>publisher_name :</span></dt><dd>Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC)</dd><dt><span>publisher_type :</span></dt><dd>institution</dd><dt><span>publisher_url :</span></dt><dd>https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov</dd><dt><span>references :</span></dt><dd>ECCO Consortium, Fukumori, I., Wang, O., Fenty, I., Forget, G., Heimbach, P., &amp; Ponte, R.

Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) state estimates are dynamically and kinematically-consistent reconstructions of the three-dimensional, time-evolving ocean, sea-ice, and surface atmospheric states. ECCO V4r4 is a free-running solution of a global, nominally 1-degree configuration of the MIT general circulation model (MITgcm) that has been fit to observations in a least-squares sense. Observational data constraints used in V4r4 include sea surface height (SSH) from satellite altimeters [ERS-1/2, TOPEX/Poseidon, GFO, ENVISAT, Jason-1,2,3, CryoSat-2, and SARAL/AltiKa]; sea surface temperature (SST) from satellite radiometers [AVHRR], sea surface salinity (SSS) from the Aquarius satellite radiometer/scatterometer, ocean bottom pressure (OBP) from the GRACE satellite gravimeter; sea-ice concentration from satellite radiometers [SSM/I and SSMIS], and in-situ ocean temperature and salinity measured with conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sensors and expendable bathythermographs (XBTs) from several programs [e.g., WOCE, GO-SHIP, Argo, and others] and platforms [e.g., research vessels, gliders, moorings, ice-tethered profilers, and instrumented pinnipeds]. V4r4 covers the period 1992-01-01T12:00:00 to 2018-01-01T00:00:00.</dd><dt><span>time_coverage_duration :</span></dt><dd>P1M</dd><dt><span>time_coverage_end :</span></dt><dd>2017-02-01T00:00:00</dd><dt><span>time_coverage_resolution :</span></dt><dd>P1M</dd><dt><span>time_coverage_start :</span></dt><dd>2017-01-01T00:00:00</dd><dt><span>title :</span></dt><dd>ECCO Sea Surface Height - Monthly Mean llc90 Grid (Version 4 Release 4)</dd><dt><span>uuid :</span></dt><dd>a21a5c30-400c-11eb-a9e0-0cc47a3f49c3</dd></dl></div></li></ul></div></div>"

Note: SSH is calculated by correcting model sea level anomaly ETAN for three effects: a) global mean steric sea level changes related to density changes in the Boussinesq volume-conserving model (Greatbatch correction, see sterGloH), b) the inverted barometer (IB) effect (see SSHIBC) and c) sea level displacement due to sea-ice and snow pressure loading (see sIceLoad). SSH can be compared with the similarly-named SSH variable in previous ECCO products that did not include atmospheric pressure loading (e.g., Version 4 Release 3). Use SSHNOIBC for comparisons with altimetry data products that do NOT apply the IB correction.</dd><dt><span>valid_min :</span></dt><dd>-1.8805772066116333</dd><dt><span>valid_max :</span></dt><dd>1.4207719564437866</dd></dl></div><div class='xr-var-data'><table>\n",

Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) state estimates are dynamically and kinematically-consistent reconstructions of the three-dimensional, time-evolving ocean, sea-ice, and surface atmospheric states. ECCO V4r4 is a free-running solution of a global, nominally 1-degree configuration of the MIT general circulation model (MITgcm) that has been fit to observations in a least-squares sense. Observational data constraints used in V4r4 include sea surface height (SSH) from satellite altimeters [ERS-1/2, TOPEX/Poseidon, GFO, ENVISAT, Jason-1,2,3, CryoSat-2, and SARAL/AltiKa]; sea surface temperature (SST) from satellite radiometers [AVHRR], sea surface salinity (SSS) from the Aquarius satellite radiometer/scatterometer, ocean bottom pressure (OBP) from the GRACE satellite gravimeter; sea-ice concentration from satellite radiometers [SSM/I and SSMIS], and in-situ ocean temperature and salinity measured with conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sensors and expendable bathythermographs (XBTs) from several programs [e.g., WOCE, GO-SHIP, Argo, and others] and platforms [e.g., research vessels, gliders, moorings, ice-tethered profilers, and instrumented pinnipeds]. V4r4 covers the period 1992-01-01T12:00:00 to 2018-01-01T00:00:00.</dd><dt><span>time_coverage_duration :</span></dt><dd>P1M</dd><dt><span>time_coverage_end :</span></dt><dd>2017-02-01T00:00:00</dd><dt><span>time_coverage_resolution :</span></dt><dd>P1M</dd><dt><span>time_coverage_start :</span></dt><dd>2017-01-01T00:00:00</dd><dt><span>title :</span></dt><dd>ECCO Sea Surface Height - Monthly Mean llc90 Grid (Version 4 Release 4)</dd><dt><span>uuid :</span></dt><dd>a21a5c30-400c-11eb-a9e0-0cc47a3f49c3</dd></dl></div></li></ul></div></div>"

    "Now plot the SSH for Jan 2017 in tile 10 (Python numbering convention; 11 in Fortran/MATLAB numbering convention). Here we use the \"RdYlBu\" colormap, one of [many built-in colormaps](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/colormap_reference.html) that the `matplotlib` package provides, or you can [create your own](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/colors/colormap-manipulation.html#colormap-manipulation). The \"_r\" at the end reverses the direction of the colormap, so red corresponds to the maximum values."

    "\n",
    "[NASA Earthdata](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search) datasets are identified by ShortNames, but you might not know the ShortName of the variable or category of variables that you are seeking. One way to find the ShortName is to consult the ECCOv4r4 [variable lists](https://ecco-v4-python-tutorial.readthedocs.io/ECCO_access_intro.html#Dataset-ShortNames-and-variables-associated-with-them). Another option is that you can specify a text string \"query\" in `ecco_access` functions. If \"query\" does not match an existing NASA Earthdata ShortName, it will conduct a case-insensitive search for exact matches of that text string among the variable names and descriptions in the variable lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: if using a \"query\" to search the variable lists, it is recommended to use a single word (or even part of a word) when possible. Since only exact text matches are identified, you are more likely to get results with a shorter query.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, perhaps you are looking to open the dataset that has native grid monthly sea ice concentration in 2007. If the query is not identified as a ShortName, then a text search of the [variable lists](https://ecco-v4-python-tutorial.readthedocs.io/ECCO_access_intro.html#Dataset-ShortNames-and-variables-associated-with-them) is conducted using *query*, *grid*, and *time_res*. Then of the identified matches, the user is asked to select one."

Note: sIceLoad is used to correct model sea level anomaly, ETAN, to calculate dynamic sea surface height, SSH, and sea surface height without the inverted barometer (IB correction), SSHNOIBC. In the model, sea-ice is treated as floating above the sea level with ETAN tracing the location of the ocean-ice interface. Consequently, sea-ice growth in the model lowers ETAN and sea-ice melting raises ETAN. Dynamic sea surface height is obtained by correcting ETAN by the weight of ice and snow directly above following Archimedes’ principle.</dd><dt><span>valid_min :</span></dt><dd>-0.00011736128362827003</dd><dt><span>valid_max :</span></dt><dd>7323.06005859375</dd></dl></div><div class='xr-var-data'><table>\n",

Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) state estimates are dynamically and kinematically-consistent reconstructions of the three-dimensional, time-evolving ocean, sea-ice, and surface atmospheric states. ECCO V4r4 is a free-running solution of a global, nominally 1-degree configuration of the MIT general circulation model (MITgcm) that has been fit to observations in a least-squares sense. Observational data constraints used in V4r4 include sea surface height (SSH) from satellite altimeters [ERS-1/2, TOPEX/Poseidon, GFO, ENVISAT, Jason-1,2,3, CryoSat-2, and SARAL/AltiKa]; sea surface temperature (SST) from satellite radiometers [AVHRR], sea surface salinity (SSS) from the Aquarius satellite radiometer/scatterometer, ocean bottom pressure (OBP) from the GRACE satellite gravimeter; sea-ice concentration from satellite radiometers [SSM/I and SSMIS], and in-situ ocean temperature and salinity measured with conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sensors and expendable bathythermographs (XBTs) from several programs [e.g., WOCE, GO-SHIP, Argo, and others] and platforms [e.g., research vessels, gliders, moorings, ice-tethered profilers, and instrumented pinnipeds]. V4r4 covers the period 1992-01-01T12:00:00 to 2018-01-01T00:00:00.</dd><dt><span>time_coverage_duration :</span></dt><dd>P1M</dd><dt><span>time_coverage_end :</span></dt><dd>2007-02-01T00:00:00</dd><dt><span>time_coverage_resolution :</span></dt><dd>P1M</dd><dt><span>time_coverage_start :</span></dt><dd>2007-01-01T00:00:00</dd><dt><span>title :</span></dt><dd>ECCO Sea-Ice and Snow Concentration and Thickness - Monthly Mean llc90 Grid (Version 4 Release 4)</dd><dt><span>uuid :</span></dt><dd>e6cdf192-400d-11eb-93b5-0cc47a3f49c3</dd></dl></div></li></ul></div></div>"

Note: SSH is calculated by correcting model sea level anomaly ETAN for three effects: a) global mean steric sea level changes related to density changes in the Boussinesq volume-conserving model (Greatbatch correction, see sterGloH), b) the inverted barometer (IB) effect (see SSHIBC) and c) sea level displacement due to sea-ice and snow pressure loading (see sIceLoad). SSH can be compared with the similarly-named SSH variable in previous ECCO products that did not include atmospheric pressure loading (e.g., Version 4 Release 3). Use SSHNOIBC for comparisons with altimetry data products that do NOT apply the IB correction.</dd><dt><span>valid_min :</span></dt><dd>-1.8805772066116333</dd><dt><span>valid_max :</span></dt><dd>1.4207719564437866</dd></dl></div><div class='xr-var-data'><table>\n",

Note: SSHNOIBC is calculated by correcting model sea level anomaly ETAN for two effects: a) global mean steric sea level changes related to density changes in the Boussinesq volume-conserving model (Greatbatch correction, see sterGloH), b) sea level displacement due to sea-ice and snow pressure loading (see sIceLoad). In ECCO Version 4 Release 4 the model is forced with atmospheric pressure loading. SSHNOIBC does not correct for the static part of the effect of atmosphere pressure loading on sea surface height (the so-called inverse barometer (IB) correction).

Note: ETAN is model sea level anomaly and should not be compared with satellite altimetery products, see SSH and ETAN for more details.</dd><dt><span>Conventions :</span></dt><dd>CF-1.8, ACDD-1.3</dd><dt><span>coordinates_comment :</span></dt><dd>Note: the global &#x27;coordinates&#x27; attribute describes auxillary coordinates.</dd><dt><span>creator_email :</span></dt><dd>ecco-group@mit.edu</dd><dt><span>creator_institution :</span></dt><dd>NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)</dd><dt><span>creator_name :</span></dt><dd>ECCO Consortium</dd><dt><span>creator_type :</span></dt><dd>group</dd><dt><span>creator_url :</span></dt><dd>https://ecco-group.org</dd><dt><span>date_created :</span></dt><dd>2020-12-16T18:07:40</dd><dt><span>date_issued :</span></dt><dd>2020-12-16T18:07:40</dd><dt><span>date_metadata_modified :</span></dt><dd>2021-03-15T21:56:49</dd><dt><span>date_modified :</span></dt><dd>2021-03-15T21:56:49</dd><dt><span>geospatial_bounds_crs :</span></dt><dd>EPSG:4326</dd><dt><span>geospatial_lat_max :</span></dt><dd>90.0</dd><dt><span>geospatial_lat_min :</span></dt><dd>-90.0</dd><dt><span>geospatial_lat_resolution :</span></dt><dd>variable</dd><dt><span>geospatial_lat_units :</span></dt><dd>degrees_north</dd><dt><span>geospatial_lon_max :</span></dt><dd>180.0</dd><dt><span>geospatial_lon_min :</span></dt><dd>-180.0</dd><dt><span>geospatial_lon_resolution :</span></dt><dd>variable</dd><dt><span>geospatial_lon_units :</span></dt><dd>degrees_east</dd><dt><span>history :</span></dt><dd>Inaugural release of an ECCO Central Estimate solution to PO.DAAC</dd><dt><span>id :</span></dt><dd>10.5067/ECL5M-SSH44</dd><dt><span>institution :</span></dt><dd>NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)</dd><dt><span>instrument_vocabulary :</span></dt><dd>GCMD instrument keywords</dd><dt><span>keywords :</span></dt><dd>EARTH SCIENCE SERVICES &gt; MODELS &gt; EARTH SCIENCE REANALYSES/ASSIMILATION MODELS, EARTH SCIENCE &gt; OCEANS &gt; SEA SURFACE TOPOGRAPHY &gt; SEA SURFACE HEIGHT</dd><dt><span>keywords_vocabulary :</span></dt><dd>NASA Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) Science Keywords</dd><dt><span>license :</span></dt><dd>Public Domain</dd><dt><span>metadata_link :</span></dt><dd>https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/collections.umm_json?ShortName=ECCO_L4_SSH_LLC0090GRID_MONTHLY_V4R4</dd><dt><span>naming_authority :</span></dt><dd>gov.nasa.jpl</dd><dt><span>platform :</span></dt><dd>ERS-1/2, TOPEX/Poseidon, Geosat Follow-On (GFO), ENVISAT, Jason-1, Jason-2, CryoSat-2, SARAL/AltiKa, Jason-3, AVHRR, Aquarius, SSM/I, SSMIS, GRACE, DTU17MDT, Argo, WOCE, GO-SHIP, MEOP, Ice Tethered Profilers (ITP)</dd><dt><span>platform_vocabulary :</span></dt><dd>GCMD platform keywords</dd><dt><span>processing_level :</span></dt><dd>L4</dd><dt><span>product_name :</span></dt><dd>SEA_SURFACE_HEIGHT_mon_mean_2015-01_ECCO_V4r4_native_llc0090.nc</dd><dt><span>product_time_coverage_end :</span></dt><dd>2018-01-01T00:00:00</dd><dt><span>product_time_coverage_start :</span></dt><dd>1992-01-01T12:00:00</dd><dt><span>product_version :</span></dt><dd>Version 4, Release 4</dd><dt><span>program :</span></dt><dd>NASA Physical Oceanography, Cryosphere, Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction (MAP)</dd><dt><span>project :</span></dt><dd>Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO)</dd><dt><span>publisher_email :</span></dt><dd>podaac@podaac.jpl.nasa.gov</dd><dt><span>publisher_institution :</span></dt><dd>PO.DAAC</dd><dt><span>publisher_name :</span></dt><dd>Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC)</dd><dt><span>publisher_type :</span></dt><dd>institution</dd><dt><span>publisher_url :</span></dt><dd>https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov</dd><dt><span>references :</span></dt><dd>ECCO Consortium, Fukumori, I., Wang, O., Fenty, I., Forget, G., Heimbach, P., &amp; Ponte, R.

Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) state estimates are dynamically and kinematically-consistent reconstructions of the three-dimensional, time-evolving ocean, sea-ice, and surface atmospheric states. ECCO V4r4 is a free-running solution of a global, nominally 1-degree configuration of the MIT general circulation model (MITgcm) that has been fit to observations in a least-squares sense. Observational data constraints used in V4r4 include sea surface height (SSH) from satellite altimeters [ERS-1/2, TOPEX/Poseidon, GFO, ENVISAT, Jason-1,2,3, CryoSat-2, and SARAL/AltiKa]; sea surface temperature (SST) from satellite radiometers [AVHRR], sea surface salinity (SSS) from the Aquarius satellite radiometer/scatterometer, ocean bottom pressure (OBP) from the GRACE satellite gravimeter; sea-ice concentration from satellite radiometers [SSM/I and SSMIS], and in-situ ocean temperature and salinity measured with conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sensors and expendable bathythermographs (XBTs) from several programs [e.g., WOCE, GO-SHIP, Argo, and others] and platforms [e.g., research vessels, gliders, moorings, ice-tethered profilers, and instrumented pinnipeds]. V4r4 covers the period 1992-01-01T12:00:00 to 2018-01-01T00:00:00.</dd><dt><span>time_coverage_duration :</span></dt><dd>P1M</dd><dt><span>time_coverage_end :</span></dt><dd>2015-02-01T00:00:00</dd><dt><span>time_coverage_resolution :</span></dt><dd>P1M</dd><dt><span>time_coverage_start :</span></dt><dd>2015-01-01T00:00:00</dd><dt><span>title :</span></dt><dd>ECCO Sea Surface Height - Monthly Mean llc90 Grid (Version 4 Release 4)</dd><dt><span>uuid :</span></dt><dd>a4955186-400c-11eb-8c14-0cc47a3f49c3</dd></dl></div></li></ul></div></div>"
