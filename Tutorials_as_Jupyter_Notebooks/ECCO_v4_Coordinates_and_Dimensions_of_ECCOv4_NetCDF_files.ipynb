    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As we showed in the first tutorial, we can use the `open_dataset` method from `xarray` to load a NetCDF tile file into Python as a `Dataset` object.  `open_dataset` is very convenient because it automatically parses the NetCDF file and constructs a `Dataset` object using all of the  dimensions, coordinates, variables, and metadata information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the last tutorial we loaded a single ECCOv4 tile file, March 2010 average potential temperature and examined its contents.  Let's load it up again and take a closer look at its coordinates.  This time we'll name the new `Dataset` object *ecco_dataset* since we are loading the file using `open_dataset`."
