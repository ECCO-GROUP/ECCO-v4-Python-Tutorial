    "# AWS Cloud: getting started and retrieving ECCO datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Previous tutorials have discussed how to download ECCO datasets from PO.DAAC to your local machine. However, during 2021-2022 PO.DAAC datasets (including ECCO) migrated to the NASA Earthdata Cloud hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS). While data downloads from the cloud (using wget, curl, Python requests, etc.) function like downloads from any other website, there are definite advantages to working with datasets within the cloud environment. Data can be opened in an S3 bucket and viewed without downloading, or can be quickly downloaded to a user's cloud instance for computations. For more information on PO.DAAC datasets in the cloud, there are [a number of infographics here](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/cloud-datasets/about).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will walk through the steps of how a user can set up an AWS instance and access ECCO datasets for computations in that instance. No prior experience with the AWS cloud is assumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up an AWS cloud instance\n",
    "Computations in the AWS Cloud are typically done in an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, which is a self-contained computing environment like the operating system on your local machine. You start an EC2 instance through the AWS Cloud management console, then connect to the instance (e.g., through `ssh`) like you would to any other machine, install the software that you need, and start working. AWS offers a [Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/?did=ft_card&trk=ft_card) that provides 750 compute hours per month, 1 GB memory, and up to 30 GB storage for a period of 12 months. This is great for experimenting, but these memory/storage limits can be quite restrictive, so if you have institutional or project support for larger instances it is highly recommended to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps here mostly follow this [excellent tutorial on the PO.DAAC Cookbook](https://podaac.github.io/tutorials/external/July_2022_Earthdata_Webinar.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Create an AWS account\n",
    "If you don't already have one, [create an account on AWS](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start/email). Anyone with an e-mail address and a credit card can do this, though for the reasons above it is recommended that you seek out institutional support if possible, or include cloud computing costs in your grant proposals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Start an EC2 instance\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: if you have an AWS account through the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), you will need to do Steps 2 and 3 differently. Please consult [these instructions](https://github.com/ECCO-GROUP/ECCO-v4-Python-Tutorial/blob/master/Cloud_Setup/JPL_setup_instructions.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you [log in](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) to your new account, you should be at a screen with the title Console Home. First, let's make sure you are in the most optimal AWS \"region\" for accessing PO.DAAC datasets, which are hosted in region *us-west-2 (Oregon)*. In the upper-right corner of the page just to the left of your username, there is a drop-down menu with a place name on it. Select the **US West (Oregon)    us-west-2** region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's start a new EC2 instance. Click on **Services** in the upper-left corner next to the AWS logo, then **Compute** --> **EC2**. On this new screen where there are a number of boxes, select the yellow **Launch instance** button. There are some settings on this screen to configure before launching the new instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Name and tags*: Whatever you want (e.g., ECCO tutorials).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Application and OS images (Amazon Machine Image)*: **Quick Start** --> **Red Hat** --> **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, SSD Volume Type**\n",
    "This is not the only AMI you can use, and your institution may have preferred or required AMIs to use AWS cloud services. Make sure that the AMI you select runs Linux, and is \"Free tier eligible\" if you are not supported by your institution or project.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Instance type*: **t2.micro** if using the Free tier. If you're not restricted to the free tier, a **t2.medium**/**t3.medium** or larger is recommended. (**t3** is a newer generation, with similar or slightly cheaper costs as **t2**.)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Key pair (login)*: Click on **Create new key pair**. In the pop-up window, make the name whatever you want (e.g., aws_ec2_jupyter), select *Key pair type*: **RSA** and *Private key file format*: **.pem**, then **Create key pair**. This downloads the key file to your Downloads folder, and you should move it to your `.ssh` folder: `mv ~/Downloads/aws_ec2_jupyter.pem ~/.ssh/`. Then change the permissions to read-only for the file owner `chmod 400 ~/.ssh/aws_ec2_jupyter.pem`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Network settings*: Your institution may have existing security groups that you should use, so click the **Select existing security group** and check with your IT or cloud support to see if there are recommended security groups/VPCs to use. If not or you are doing this on your own, then click **Create security group**, which will create a new security group with a name like *launch-wizard-1*. Make sure that the boxes to allow HTTPS and HTTP traffic from the internet are checked.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Configure storage*: Specify a storage volume with at least **15 GiB gp3** as your root volume. This is important, since the python/conda installation with the packages we need will occupy ~7.5 GB, and we need some workspace as a buffer. If you are in Free tier then you can request up to 30 GB across all your instances, so you can use up the full amount in a single instance or split it across two instances with 15 GB each.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Advanced details*: Depending on your security/institutional requirements, you may need to include a specific IAM profile. Check the *IAM instance profile* dropdown menu to see if there is one associated with your security group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, at the bottom-right of the page click the yellow **Launch instance** button. Wait a minute or two for the instance to initialize; you can check the **Instances** screen accessed from the menu on the left side to see that your Instance state is **Running**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Install software and set up conda environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Since your instance starts with a very bare-bones Linux OS, you will need to install software (conda/miniconda/miniforge) to run Python, and then install Python packages and the Jupyter interface to run these tutorial notebooks. A shell script to expedite this process is provided on the tutorial Github page, and here we will walk through setting this up.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, ssh into your new instance. For most users this will be at the public IPv4 address on the AWS instance summary page, e.g., if the IP address is 35.24.135.171, then: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ssh -i \"~/.ssh/aws_ec2_jupyter.pem\" ec2-user@35.24.135.171 -L 9889:localhost:9889\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Some users with an institutional network or VPN might use the private IP address instead. The `-L` option indicates a tunnel from the local machine's port 9889 to the instance's port 9889; this will be used later to open Jupyterlab through your local machine's web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Tip: If you are having difficulty connecting to your new instance, you might need to change your network/security group settings to allow SSH traffic from your local machine and/or HTTPS/HTTP traffic. Alternatively, you may need to [attach an IAM role to your instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will update the OS on the instance and install `git` so that we can clone the [ECCOv4 Python tutorial repository](https://github.com/ECCO-GROUP/ECCO-v4-Python-Tutorial). This repository includes a shell script that can be used to finish setting up our workspace. First copy and paste the following commands into the instance's terminal window, and execute:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo dnf update -y && sudo dnf install git -y && cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/ECCO-GROUP/ECCO-v4-Python-Tutorial.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will execute a shell script in the Github repository we just cloned, `jupyter_env_setup.sh`. This script handles most of our environment setup, by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Installing `wget` (which allows us to download from internet websites)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Installing `tmux` (which allows us to persist tasks on a remote machine even when disconnected).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Downloading `Miniforge.sh` from *conda-forge* which enables us to install `conda` and `mamba` (a faster, C-based `conda`) in the `/tmp` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creating a new conda environment called `jupyter` that will contain the packages we need to run the notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Installing Python packages using a combination of `mamba` and `pip` (the latter works better when memory is limited).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Querying the user for their NASA Earthdata username and password (if these are already archived in a `~/.netrc` file this step is skipped).\n",
    "\n",
    "To run `jupyter_env_setup.sh`, copy, paste, and execute the following two commands on the instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo chmod 755 ~/ECCO-v4-Python-Tutorial/Cloud_Setup/jupyter_env_setup.sh && ~/ECCO-v4-Python-Tutorial/Cloud_Setup/jupyter_env_setup.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The script takes a few minutes to run, but it should set up our environment with the packages we need, even within the memory constraints of a free-tier t2.micro instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Start a Jupyter lab session\n",
    "\n",
    "With the `jupyter` environment set up and credentials archived, we can run one more shell script to start a Jupyter lab session on the instance. The session will be opened using a `tmux` window; `tmux` is a program (similar to `screen`) that allows a session to be detached from the user's window to run in the background, and persist on a remote machine even after the user disconnects. The previous script created a symbolic link in the home directory that allows us to launch a Jupyterlab session easily after log in. Execute the following in the instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "~/jupyter_lab_start.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will get a prompt for a password (optional), or you can leave it blank and press enter. After this is done (and while still connected to your instance through port 9889), open up a window in your local machine's web browser and put ``http://127.0.0.1:9889/`` or ``http://localhost:9889/`` in the URL field. If you set a password for your session, enter it when prompted. A Jupyter lab should open up in the ECCOv4 tutorial Github repository on your instance. Go to the **Tutorials_as_Jupyter_Notebooks** directory, and you will see a number of notebooks ready to run! For example, you can access this one at *AWS_Cloud_getting_started.ipynb*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reconnecting to your instance and Jupyter lab\n",
    "\n",
    "### Re-connecting to an active Jupyter lab session\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start a Jupyter lab session with `~/jupyter_lab_start.sh`, the session persists even after you disconnect from your instance. So in order to re-connect to your active session on the cloud, all you need to do is use a terminal window to re-connect to your instance, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ssh -i \"~/.ssh/aws_ec2_jupyter.pem\" ec2-user@instance_ip_address -L 9889:localhost:9889\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and then open ``http://localhost:9889/`` in your local machine's web browser again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stop/start your instance and starting a new Jupyter lab session\n",
    "\n",
    "If you will not be working in your instance for a little while, it is a good idea to stop the instance to save on potential AWS computing costs, and then start it again when you resume work. The instance will *hibernate*, and usage and data transfer fees will not be incurred, though volume (storage) fees will still be incurred by a stopped instance if applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instances can be stopped and started through your [AWS web console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/). To stop an instance, go to **EC2** --> **Instances**, then select the checkbox next to your instance and use the **Instance state** drop-down menu to **Stop instance**. When you are ready to start working again, you will go to the same menu and select **Start instance**, and wait about 1-3 minutes for the instance to run again. There is also an [AWS command line interface (CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) that you can use to [list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.html), [stop](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/stop-instances.html), and [start](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/start-instances.html) instances.  When your instance is running again, you should be able to connect, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ssh -i \"~/.ssh/aws_ec2_jupyter.pem\" ec2-user@instance_ip_address -L 9889:localhost:9889\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once connected to your instance you will need to start a new Jupyter lab session by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "~/jupyter_lab_start.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and then you can open ``http://localhost:9889/`` in your local machine's web browser and start working again.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing ECCO datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "One nice aspect of working in the cloud where ECCO output is hosted is that you don't need to download and store the output on your local machine. The output is hosted in **S3**, the AWS Cloud's massive storage system, and you can load the output into your notebook workspace and scripts directly from S3. However, if you are doing multiple computations with the same dataset(s), you will likely save time by copying it to your instance's local storage. The *ecco_s3_retrieve* Python module (which is similar to the *ecco_download* module for downloading ECCO datasets) allows us to both open the files directly from S3 and to make a copy of the files on your instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll use both access methods to compute the global mean ocean temperature from ECCOv4, for the 12 months in the year 2010, and log the time it takes to retrieve the files and perform the computation. We'll also try using multiple threads and processes to carry out the computation in parallel using `dask.distributed` (note that you can't benefit from this capability on *t2.micro* and *t2.small* instances as they only have 1 vCPU)."

In other words, the logical vertical grid of MITgcm ocean variables is inverted relative to the physical vertical grid.</dd></dl></div><div class='xr-var-data'><table>\n",

Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) state estimates are dynamically and kinematically-consistent reconstructions of the three-dimensional, time-evolving ocean, sea-ice, and surface atmospheric states. ECCO V4r4 is a free-running solution of a global, nominally 1-degree configuration of the MIT general circulation model (MITgcm) that has been fit to observations in a least-squares sense. Observational data constraints used in V4r4 include sea surface height (SSH) from satellite altimeters [ERS-1/2, TOPEX/Poseidon, GFO, ENVISAT, Jason-1,2,3, CryoSat-2, and SARAL/AltiKa]; sea surface temperature (SST) from satellite radiometers [AVHRR], sea surface salinity (SSS) from the Aquarius satellite radiometer/scatterometer, ocean bottom pressure (OBP) from the GRACE satellite gravimeter; sea-ice concentration from satellite radiometers [SSM/I and SSMIS], and in-situ ocean temperature and salinity measured with conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sensors and expendable bathythermographs (XBTs) from several programs [e.g., WOCE, GO-SHIP, Argo, and others] and platforms [e.g., research vessels, gliders, moorings, ice-tethered profilers, and instrumented pinnipeds]. V4r4 covers the period 1992-01-01T12:00:00 to 2018-01-01T00:00:00.</dd><dt><span>time_coverage_duration :</span></dt><dd>P1M</dd><dt><span>time_coverage_end :</span></dt><dd>2010-02-01T00:00:00</dd><dt><span>time_coverage_resolution :</span></dt><dd>P1M</dd><dt><span>time_coverage_start :</span></dt><dd>2010-01-01T00:00:00</dd><dt><span>title :</span></dt><dd>ECCO Ocean Temperature and Salinity - Monthly Mean llc90 Grid (Version 4 Release 4)</dd><dt><span>uuid :</span></dt><dd>f4291248-4181-11eb-82cd-0cc47a3f446d</dd></dl></div></li></ul></div></div>"

Parameters include areas and lengths of grid cell sides, horizontal and vertical coordinates of grid cell centers and corners, grid rotation angles, and global domain geometry including bathymetry and land/ocean masks. Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) state estimates are dynamically and kinematically-consistent reconstructions of the three-dimensional, time-evolving ocean, sea-ice, and surface atmospheric states. ECCO V4r4 is a free-running solution of a global, nominally 1-degree configuration of the MIT general circulation model (MITgcm) that has been fit to observations in a least-squares sense. Observational data constraints used in V4r4 include sea surface height (SSH) from satellite altimeters [ERS-1/2, TOPEX/Poseidon, GFO, ENVISAT, Jason-1,2,3, CryoSat-2, and SARAL/AltiKa]; sea surface temperature (SST) from satellite radiometers [AVHRR], sea surface salinity (SSS) from the Aquarius satellite radiometer/scatterometer, ocean bottom pressure (OBP) from the GRACE satellite gravimeter; sea-ice concentration from satellite radiometers [SSM/I and SSMIS], and in-situ ocean temperature and salinity measured with conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sensors and expendable bathythermographs (XBTs) from several programs [e.g., WOCE, GO-SHIP, Argo, and others] and platforms [e.g., research vessels, gliders, moorings, ice-tethered profilers, and instrumented pinnipeds]. V4r4 covers the period 1992-01-01T12:00:00 to 2018-01-01T00:00:00.</dd><dt><span>title :</span></dt><dd>ECCO Geometry Parameters for the Lat-Lon-Cap 90 (llc90) Native Model Grid (Version 4 Release 4)</dd><dt><span>uuid :</span></dt><dd>87ff7d24-86e5-11eb-9c5f-f8f21e2ee3e0</dd></dl></div></li></ul></div></div>"

However, because of the overhead introduced by the `distributed` scheduler, this will not always speed up your code. This method works best when it is used to open files into xarray datasets with *open_mfdataset* (which by default does not immediately load the data into memory), and then a subset of the data can be loaded into memory at the earliest reasonable opportunity."
